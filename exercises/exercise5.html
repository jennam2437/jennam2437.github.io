        <h1>About me...</h1>
        <h2>Short bio</h2>
        <p>I am an honors student studying english at the University of Massachusetts Amherst! I enjoy travelling, reading, video games, and figure skating.</p>

        <h2>UMass Activities</h2>
        <p>I am an english major with an <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> minor, and also pursuing the <abbr title="Professional Writing and Technical Communication">PWTC</abbr> certification. I am a member of the Commonwealth Honors College, the UMass Synchronized Skating Team, and an IT student ambassador. On the skating team, I hold the position of treasurer. I created our budget, handle dues, and communicate with UMass finances. As an IT student ambassador, I am responsible for promoting IT matters on social media, providing feedback on campus technology, and tabling. I am hoping to enter a career in technical writing or brand management! I am excited to use my communication and technology skills as I enter the workforce.</p>
