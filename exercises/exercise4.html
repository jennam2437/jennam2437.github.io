            <h1>Exercise 4 - Images</h1>

            <h2>Image 1: Frankenstein</h2>
            <p>I am not sure what I want my final website to look like yet, so I am experimenting with some ideas. I chose this image because I have read Frankenstein many times, and I would like to dedicate a section of my website to the gothic media I've consumed recently.</p>

            <h2>Image 2: Nosferatu</h2>
            <p>I have seen the Nosferatu film by Robert Eggers a few times. I chose this image because I would like to watch the 1922 version of the film.</p>

            <h2>Image 3: My image</h2>
            <p>I chose this image because I felt like it fit the vibe of the previous photos, but it was taken by me!</p>
