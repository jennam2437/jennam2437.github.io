            <h2>The Community Center</h2>
            <p>The main storyline of Stardew Valley lies in the Community Center, which is unlocked on Spring 5. You must complete all bundles and rooms in the community center to unlock it. Alternatively, if you purchase a membership at JojaMart for $5,000, the Community Center is replaced by a Joja Warehouse. There are 5 rooms in the community center, with 6 bundles in each. They are unlocked in this order.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Crafts Room</li>
                <li>Pantry</li>
                <li>Fish Tank</li>
                <li>Boiler Room</li>
                <li>Bulletin Board</li>
                <li>Vault</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After completing the Community Center, the entire town will celebrate the restoration of the building, earning you the "Local Legend" Achievement. Ginger Island is also unlocked.</p>

            <h2>Relationships</h2>
            <p>Relationships with the townspeople is an important aspect of the game. As friendships deepen, villagers become more friendly, cutscenes are unlocked, they are more likely to send recipies in the mail, and marriage is possible with elligible candidates. Villagers who are able to be married are labelled as (Single) in the relationship menu. Friendship is measured in a hear system. Non-marriage candidates have a 10-heart maximum. Marriage candidates will pause at 8-hearts, the last two being saved for romantic interest. Once you marry a villager, their maximum hearts rises to 14.</p>
            <p>Gift-giving is essential to maintaining relationships. The <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki">Stardew Valley Wiki</a> is helpful for gift-giving, as each villager has their own unique likes, loves, and dislikes. Giving a villager a loved item on their birthday is the quickest way to boost friendship. Once you have reached 8 hearts with any elligible bachelor/bachelorette, you can gift them a bouquet, which will initiate a romantic relationship. Breaking off a romantic relationship will lower friendship.</p>
            <p>The elligible bachelors and bacheloettes are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bachelors
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alex</li>
                        <li>Elliot</li>
                        <li>Harvey</li>
                        <li>Sam</li>
                        <li>Sebastian</li>
                        <li>Shane</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Bachelorettes
                    <ul>
                        <li>Abigail</li>
                        <li>Emily</li>
                        <li>Haley</li>
                        <li>Leah</li>
                        <li>Maru</li>
                        <li>Penny</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Fishing</h2>
            <p><a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fishing">Fishing</a> will be integral to your success in Stardew Valley. You can fish in 4 main locations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mountain Lake</li>
                    <li>Forest Pond</li>
                    <li>River</li>
                    <li>Ocean</li>
                </ul>
                
            <p>More locations will become available as you progess through the game. Willy will send you a letter in the mail to come see him, and will then give you a Bamboo Fishing Rod. When fishing, the goal is to keep the green bar aligned with the fish. As your fishing level increases, the green bar becomes larger and easier to keep aligned with the fish. You will also be able to buy better fishing rods from Willys' shop. The fishing mini-game is notoriously difficult, so don't get discouraged if you struggle at first! Trout soup and the training rod are available at Willy's shop. They will help you get the hang of fishing before transitioning back to your standard rod.</p>
